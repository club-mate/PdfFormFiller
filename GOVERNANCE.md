# Project Governance

## Overview

This document describes the governance structure and decision-making processes for the PDF Form Filler project.

## Core Principles

1. **Community-Driven**: We value contributions and feedback from all community members
2. **Transparent**: Decisions are made openly with clear communication
3. **Inclusive**: All voices are heard and respected
4. **Merit-Based**: Decisions are based on technical merit and community benefit
5. **Fair**: Equal consideration regardless of background, affiliation, or status

## Decision-Making Process

### Low-Impact Decisions
**Examples**: Documentation updates, minor bug fixes, test improvements

**Process**:
1. Issue created or PR submitted
2. Single maintainer review
3. Can be merged with one approval

### Medium-Impact Decisions
**Examples**: Bug fixes with broader impact, minor feature additions, dependency updates

**Process**:
1. Discussion in GitHub issue/PR
2. Code review by 1-2 maintainers
3. Discussion period: 2-5 days (or until consensus)
4. Merged with maintainer approval

### High-Impact Decisions
**Examples**: Major features, breaking changes, architecture decisions, license changes

**Process**:
1. RFC (Request for Comments) created
